            It's a non-profit organization initiated by students of <a href="https://www.sharda.ac.in/" target="_blank"><u>Sharda University</u></a> in memory of our beloved dog, Daisy. <br>
            On her birthday, we embarked on a mission to care for the dogs, starting with our university dogs and soon expanding. <br>
            Our efforts include providing food, winter jackets, basic medication, and more within our means. Whether you can sponsor dog food or join us in feeding, every contribution counts.
